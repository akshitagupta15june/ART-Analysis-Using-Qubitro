# Acceleration, Rotation, Temperature Analysis using MPU-6050, ESP8266, and Qubitro.

we are going to learn how to measure gravitational acceleration, rotational velocity, and temperature using the MPU-6050 accelerometer and gyroscope module, NodeMCU ESP8266, and Qubitro.

These times when everyone is working from home, the main problem we are facing is backbone issues that is occurring because we are not maintaining proper posture while sitting in front of our computers, so this project can be very useful to determine the posture of a human body as MPU-6050 is an ideal sensor to know the orientation of moving objects and we can easily do the analysis at the Qubitro platform.

The MPU-6050 is a 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope sensor. The accelerometer measures the gravitational acceleration, and the gyroscope measures the rotational velocity and temperature.

### Hardware Requirements
